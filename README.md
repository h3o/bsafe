The code should reliably compile against ESP-IDF version 4.4, we used commit a49e0180ee638e41876a8f7bc6428a983fc69d66 from 18/08/2023 08:33:19

Configuration for Eclipse IDE (2022-12) is included as an example of how to configure the project (you will need to edit all paths).
It's not the best way how to set it up, certain features did not work for me with this setup (e.g. navigation around errors & warnings),
but at least it compiles.
